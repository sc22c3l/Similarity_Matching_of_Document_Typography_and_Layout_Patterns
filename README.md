# Similarity_Matching_of_Document_Typography_and_Layout_Patterns
This project evaluates the typography and layout similarity between an input document image and reference examples in a database using Prolog-based algorithms. 

And a brief summary of the operating steps:

(1) Check system compatibility, especially ensuring SWI-Prolog software and pyswip library are installed.
(2) Run the 'app.py' file.
(3) After successful execution, access the web application at: http://localhost:5000/.

Test images can be found in the '/picture' folder and test line groups are in the 'Some text example.txt' file.
